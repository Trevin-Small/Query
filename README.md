### Like Wordle, but the daily word has a random length.

Thats about it. This is still a work in progress! (it has been dead for a while, but I plan on finishing it eventually...)

## Features
- A pretty large dictionary of ~30k words and their plural forms (though same may be incorrect)
- Global statistics of all daily players and how many attempts it took to solve the puzzle
- Randomized word length (5 to 9 characters inclusive)
